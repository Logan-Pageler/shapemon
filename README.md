## Welcome to the world of shapemon!!!

This was my teams final project for introduction to computer programming in my freshman year of high school.

The code is definitely a mess, and this project was a huge learning experience but none the less, the game is pretty fun.

I drew half the assets, and one of my friends drew the other half (I think? but also maybe they just took them from online because they
look scarily similiar to pokemon emerald)

The code was pretty evenly divided between my group of 3. Although I have made a few changes since its submission (fixing game breaking bugs)
but I tried to leave the original structure the same. (As much as hurts because of its messiness)

Feel free to give the jar a run.
